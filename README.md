## Who'm I?
My BA's in music, but I like coding; I do web development (mostly full-stack
JavaScript, lately). I also like playing with Python and C.

## My story
I started teaching myself computing a few years ago. I started by
[building a compiler](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) in Python. I switched to
Linux, because getting experience with your production environment is a good
idea. I tried (and try) to figure out how everything works. Now, I want to _get
paid_ to figure out how everything works.

Lately, I've been learning web development (with help from [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/)).
